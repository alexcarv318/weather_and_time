# weather_and_time
This is a django app with some interesting python scripts. First of all, I used the ip api to calculate the user's ip. Next, using the JavaScript Date() object, I calculate the current time of the user. Also, using the openweather api, I pass the user's city specified by ip address and find out the current weather and the forecast for the next 5 days. Changing the background video depending on the weather.

One of my first projects
